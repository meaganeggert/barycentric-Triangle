### Barycentric Triangle Rasterization
Using barycentric coordinates and linear algebra, render a triangle to the screen and color it on a gradient. These are the instructions we were given for the assignment:

---

For this assignment you must draw a triangle on the screen.

The starter code gives you the three locations of the row and column of the
three points of the triangle on the screen, and what colors they should have.

Grade:
F - You didn't do anything
D - You printed out the triangles with like some ASCII codes or something
C - You used the colors library to draw the edges of the triangle on the
screen
B - You used the colors library to fill in the triangle on the screen (solid
shading)
A - You used barycentric coordinates to fill and color the triangle,
interpolating between the colors of three vertices correctly.

There is no autograder.

May the odds ever be in your favor.
